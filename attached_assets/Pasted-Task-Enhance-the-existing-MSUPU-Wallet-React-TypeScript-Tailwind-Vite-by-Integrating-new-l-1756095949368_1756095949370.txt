Task:
Enhance the existing MSUPU Wallet (React + TypeScript + Tailwind, Vite) by:

Integrating new loan design elements for medical + transport support.

Fixing currently non-functional buttons (Apply for Loan, Add Savings, Add Loan Payment).

Ensuring changes remain an add-on to the current MSUPU wallet infrastructure, not a separate module.

Instructions for Code Integration
1. Loan Add-On Design & UI

Extend wallet’s UI with a Loan Options Modal/Screen accessible from “Apply for Loan.”

Loan categories should include:

Emergency Medical Loan (for urgent treatments, hospital admission)

Antenatal Care (ANC) Loan

Delivery Loan

Maternal & Child Health Services Loan (postnatal, immunization, pediatrics)

Transport Loan (emergency ambulance, caregiver transport)

Each loan card should display:

Loan type title + description

Eligibility status indicator (linked to GenAI Credit Profiles)

“Apply Now” button → triggers loan application form

2. Fix Non-Functional Buttons

Apply for Loan

Implement click event → open loan selection modal.

Enable loan application form submission (dummy API integration or hook into backend).

Add Savings

Implement form modal → input savings amount → confirm & update wallet balance.

Add Loan Payment

Implement form → repayment amount entry → update loan balance.

Add confirmation feedback (toast/alert).

3. Component Implementation (React + Tailwind)

Create reusable components inside /src/components/wallet/:

LoanOptionCard.tsx – displays loan type info, eligibility, and apply button.

LoanApplicationModal.tsx – form for selecting loan type, amount, repayment terms.

SavingsModal.tsx – input for adding savings.

LoanRepaymentModal.tsx – input for repayment.

Style with Tailwind utilities for responsive, mobile-first design.

Use theme tokens from tailwind.config.js (extend if new colors/icons are required).

4. Accessibility & Inclusivity

Ensure all new buttons/forms have aria-labels and semantic markup.

Support low literacy by pairing icons + text labels.

Maintain color contrast (WCAG AA).

5. Integration into MSUPU Wallet

Modify existing wallet pages (Dashboard.tsx, Wallet.tsx, or Loans.tsx) to import the new components.

Ensure loan, savings, and repayment flows integrate seamlessly with current MSUPU infrastructure (no new routing outside wallet).

6. Deliverables

Updated React + Tailwind component files:

LoanOptionCard.tsx

LoanApplicationModal.tsx

SavingsModal.tsx

LoanRepaymentModal.tsx

Fixed implementations for:

Apply for Loan

Add Savings

Add Loan Payment

Updated tailwind.config.js (if new tokens were added).
