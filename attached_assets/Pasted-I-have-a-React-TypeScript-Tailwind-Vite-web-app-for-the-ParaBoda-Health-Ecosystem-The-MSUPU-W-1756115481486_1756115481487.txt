I have a React + TypeScript + Tailwind (Vite) web app for the ParaBoda Health Ecosystem. The MSUPU Wallet (CommunityDashboard and Loan modules) has several bugs and missing features.

Please update the code as follows:

1. Fix Non-Functional Buttons

SHA Loan Request Button

In the Loan Request section → make the "Request SHA Loan" button open the SHALoanRequestForm.

Restrict SHA loans to annual SHA subscription only.

View Credit Report Page

Ensure "View Credit Report" opens CreditReportModal with functional tabs/buttons (e.g., Loan History, Active Loans).

Add sample data if backend isn’t connected.

Apply for Loan Section

Ensure "Apply for Loan" opens MedicalLoanOptions.

After selecting a loan type, open LoanApplicationForm with prefilled loan type.

Enforce loan amount validation: max = Ksh 10,000.

Loan Payment Feature

Ensure LoanPaymentForm lists all active loans (including SHA loans).

Allow repayments only up to the outstanding balance.

Loan History, Add Savings, Rewards, etc.

Make all currently static buttons (Loan History, Add Savings, etc.) open their respective modals or pages.

2. SHA Loan Enhancements

SHA Loan should only be available for paying the annual subscription.

In SHALoanRequestForm:

Loan type = "SHA Contribution Loan" (locked).

Max amount = Ksh 10,000.

Add repayment plan (monthly/quarterly) field for SHA repayment.

SHA loan repayment option must appear inside LoanPaymentForm when caregiver has an active SHA loan.

3. Loan Amount Restriction

Globally enforce max loan amount = Ksh 10,000 across all loan application forms.

Show validation error if user enters > 10,000.

4. Responsive & Accessible Buttons

All buttons in MSUPU Wallet Overview + Dashboard must:

Have aria-label for accessibility.

Be responsive (min-h-[48px], px-4 py-2).

Use Tailwind hover + active states (e.g., hover:scale-105, active:scale-95).

5. Deliverables

Updated CommunityDashboard.tsx with all fixed button handlers.

Updated modals/forms:

LoanApplicationForm.tsx (loan cap 10,000).

LoanPaymentForm.tsx (include SHA loans).

SHALoanRequestForm.tsx (restricted loan type).

CreditReportModal.tsx (functional buttons).

AddSavingsForm.tsx (fully functional).

Ensure all wallet actions (Apply for Loan, Add Savings, Loan Repayment, View Credit Report, Request SHA Loan) are working and responsive.
