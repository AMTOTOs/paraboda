Update the Caregivers’ Dashboard so that it fully integrates and displays all M-SUPU Wallet features in the Overview section. Make non-functional buttons active, and add new functionality for caregivers to register and contribute to the Social Health Insurance Fund (SHA).

Instructions for Code Integration

Replicate MSUPU Wallet in Caregivers’ Dashboard

Ensure the Overview section of the Caregivers’ Dashboard includes all MSUPU Wallet features:

Savings balance

Loan history + active loans

Credit profile summary

Apply for Loan option

Add Savings

Loan Repayment

Display these using consistent Tailwind-styled cards or a grid layout.

Ensure styling is aligned with tailwind.config.js tokens (colors, spacing, radius).

Fix Non-Functional Buttons

View Credit Report → Open modal or navigate to a dedicated /credit-report route. Display:

Credit score summary

Loan repayment history

Eligibility/trust indicators

Apply for Loan → Link to existing loan flow (LoanApplicationForm). Allow selection of loan type (emergency, ANC, delivery, maternal health, transport).

New Feature – SHA Contributions & Loans

Add SHA Card in Overview with two options:

Register & Contribute with Savings

Deduct contribution directly from caregiver’s community wallet balance.

Request Loan for SHA Registration

Open loan modal pre-tagged as “SHA Contribution Loan.”

Create new components in /src/components/wallet/sha/:

SHAContributionForm.tsx → handles registration + savings deduction.

SHALoanRequestForm.tsx → loan request tied specifically to SHA costs.

Integration & UX

Update /src/pages/CaregiverDashboard.tsx to import and render:

CreditProfileCard

LoanApplicationForm

SHAContributionForm

SHALoanRequestForm

Place MSUPU features prominently in the Overview grid, above secondary sections.

Ensure all forms handle validation + API submission (with loading/error states).

Accessibility & Inclusivity

Add aria-label for all interactive elements.

Ensure minimum tap/click target (min-h-[48px]).

Pair icons with text (low literacy support).

Provide multilingual labels (integrate with existing i18n.ts).
