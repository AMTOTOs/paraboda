Fix Loan Features in ParaBoda React + Tailwind App

I have a React + TypeScript + Tailwind (Vite) web application for the ParaBoda Health Ecosystem (with MSUPU wallet).

Several issues need to be fixed in the loan system.

Please do the following:

SHA Loan Request Button

The "Request SHA Loan" button inside the Loan Request section is not functioning.

Ensure it opens the SHA Loan Request Form/Page (SHALoanRequestForm or /sha-loan-request).

Validate inputs before submission.

Credit Report Page Buttons

On the View Credit Report page, none of the action buttons are working.

Fix all event handlers so that they properly:

Fetch/display loan history.

Navigate to loan repayment if applicable.

Close modals when expected.

Apply for Loan Section

The Apply for Loan button should open the MedicalLoanOptions modal.

Ensure loan types can be selected (Emergency, ANC, Delivery, Maternal Health, Transport, SHA).

Fix the flow so selecting a loan type opens the LoanApplicationForm.

Make Loan Payment Section

Currently, some loans are missing from the dropdown/list when choosing which loan to repay.

Fix it so all active loans appear, including SHA loans.

When making a payment, deduct from the correct loan balance.

Add SHA Loan Repayment option with the same logic.

Loan Amount Cap

All loan requests (including SHA, Medical, Transport, etc.) must be capped at KES 10,000 maximum.

Validate this in the frontend form (disable submit if > 10,000).

Show error message: "Loan requests cannot exceed KES 10,000."

General Improvements

Ensure all buttons have proper onClick handlers and are not silently failing.

Add loading and error states for loan submission and repayment.

Ensure UI updates after loan actions (refresh loan list, balances, repayments).

Deliverables

Fixed Loan Request flow (all categories + SHA).

Working SHA Loan Request button.

Functional Credit Report page buttons.

Functional Apply for Loan section.

Fixed Loan Payment (all loans listed, repayment applied correctly).

Added SHA Loan repayment option.

Enforced KES 10,000 max loan limit across all loan forms.
