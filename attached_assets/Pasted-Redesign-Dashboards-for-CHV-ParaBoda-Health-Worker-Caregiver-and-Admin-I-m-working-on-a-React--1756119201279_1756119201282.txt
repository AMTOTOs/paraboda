Redesign Dashboards for CHV, ParaBoda, Health Worker, Caregiver, and Admin

I’m working on a React + TypeScript + Tailwind (Vite) project for the ParaBoda ecosystem.
The Caregiver Dashboard has already been upgraded with a new MSUPU Wallet overview, functional quick actions, SHA loan features, and emergency requests.

Now I need the CHV (Community Health Volunteer), ParaBoda, and Health Worker dashboards to be redesigned so they align with the Caregiver dashboard in layout, functionality, and UX consistency.

Tasks
1. Standardize Dashboards (CHV, ParaBoda, Health Worker)

Use the same visual structure as the Caregiver Dashboard:

Top Welcome Section (user greeting + wallet balance).

MSUPU Wallet Overview (savings, loans, credit, SHA).

Quick Actions (Apply for Loan, Add Savings, Loan Payment, View Credit Report, Rewards, Transport, Health Services).

Active Loans + Loan History.

Community Rewards section (linked to activities).

Ensure all buttons are functional and responsive (no static buttons).

2. Admin Dashboard Enhancements

Add a Quick Overview section with metrics displayed in graphs:

Active users

Total savings across community

Loans issued vs. repaid

Emergency requests

SHA contributions

Use Recharts or a similar React charting library.

Add a section where the Admin can switch into any user’s dashboard (Caregiver, CHV, ParaBoda, Health Worker) to view their activities in real time.

3. Emergency Requests

For Caregivers, move Emergency Request inside the Health Services category, instead of being a standalone Quick Action.

Emergency Request should open a modal (ServiceRequestModal) with transport type and distance-based cost (Base 500 + 40 per km).

4. Landing Page Simplification

Redesign the landing page to make navigation simpler:

Clean hero section introducing the ParaBoda Health Ecosystem.

Login options (Caregiver, CHV, ParaBoda, Health Worker, Admin).

One-click navigation into each dashboard.

Use a minimal Tailwind grid layout, icons, and consistent color scheme.

Deliverables

Updated CHVDashboard.tsx, ParaBodaDashboard.tsx, HealthWorkerDashboard.tsx with the same structure/features as Caregiver Dashboard.

Updated AdminDashboard.tsx with:

Graph-based quick overview.

User dashboard access feature.

Updated CaregiverDashboard.tsx so that Emergency Request is under Health Services.

New simplified LandingPage.tsx with clean navigation.
