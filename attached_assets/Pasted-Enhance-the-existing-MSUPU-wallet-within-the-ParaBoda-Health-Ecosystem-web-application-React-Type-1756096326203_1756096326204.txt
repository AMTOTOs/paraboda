Enhance the existing MSUPU wallet within the ParaBoda Health Ecosystem web application (React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite) by:

Integrating new loan features (medical + transport-focused).

Making existing wallet actions functional (Apply for Loan, Add Savings, Add Loan Payment).

Ensuring all features (existing + new) appear consistently in both the MSUPU Wallet Overview and the Dashboard.

Instructions for Code Integration
1. Tailwind Design System Updates

Extend tailwind.config.js:

New color tokens (loan categories, health/transport indicators).

Extended typography for section titles & buttons.

Consistent rounded-lg / shadow-md tokens for cards.

2. Loan Feature Add-On (Medical + Transport Loans)

In /src/components/wallet/loans/, create:

MedicalLoanOptions.tsx

Displays loan categories as clickable cards:

Emergency Assistance

Antenatal Care (ANC)

Delivery Support

Maternal Health Services

Transport to Care Facilities

Each card triggers a modal/form to start the loan application flow.

LoanApplicationForm.tsx

Dynamic form component with:

Loan type selection (from above categories).

Loan amount field.

Purpose description (optional).

Submit button → triggers backend call.

3. Wallet Overview & Dashboard Integration

In /src/pages/Dashboard.tsx and /src/pages/WalletOverview.tsx:

Add a "Loans" section that lists both:

Current active loans (with status: pending, approved, repaid).

Shortcut buttons for Apply for Loan (linked to MedicalLoanOptions).

Display savings balance + loan eligibility score (from Credit Profiles).

4. Fix Non-Functional Buttons

Apply for Loan

Connect to MedicalLoanOptions.tsx.

Add Savings

Trigger a modal with AddSavingsForm.tsx → submit to /savings API endpoint.

Add Loan Payment

Create LoanPaymentForm.tsx → select active loan + amount → submit to /loans/payment API endpoint.

All buttons should now:

Open the proper modal.

Validate inputs.

Call backend API with error handling + loading states.

5. Accessibility & UX Enhancements

All new buttons: aria-label + role="button".

Minimum button size: min-h-[48px] px-4.

High-contrast color for medical loans (e.g., bg-red-500 text-white).

Multilingual labels (connect to i18n.ts if already implemented).

6. Deliverables

New components:

MedicalLoanOptions.tsx

LoanApplicationForm.tsx

LoanPaymentForm.tsx

AddSavingsForm.tsx

Updated:

Dashboard.tsx

WalletOverview.tsx

tailwind.config.js (with new tokens)
